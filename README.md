Weighted Epigenomic Network (WEoN) is a Cytoscape app that incorporates a filtering method to determine context-specific gene regulatory networks. The method employs diverse data to filter out regulatory connections between genes. WEoN uses histone modifications through Chromatin Inmunoprecipitation followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq), gene expression through RNA-seq, and chromatin accesibility through DNase-seq data. A serie of heuristic filters removes known and inferred regulations (like Transcription factors and regulatory RNAs) from a Gene Regulatory Network (GRN) considered as a Reference Network (e.g. a GRN with all known connections, regardless development stage or cell type). The corresponding context-specific GRN considers weighted information, and the generated network can be further analyzed within the Cytoscape software.
